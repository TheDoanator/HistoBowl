## Why I Built This ##
The Professional Bowlers Association once hosted a full archive of standings, but since 2020 their official records have disappeared behind a placeholder page. Today, the only way to find much of bowlingâ€™s history is through the Wayback Machine, scattered Wikipedia entries, or outdated fan sites.

As both a lifelong bowler and a former bowling content creator, I wanted to change that. HistoBowl is my attempt to create the only living, complete archive of professional bowling history, one thatâ€™s modern, searchable, and built to last.

This project also reflects my career path in computer science: combining web development, databases, and my passion for bowling into what I hope will become both a comprehensive resource for fans and my largest portfolio project to date.
